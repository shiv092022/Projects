Criminal Face detection using different transformation techniques 
One of the primary challenges faced by law enforcement agencies is the accurate identification and tracking of criminal suspects, especially when suspects intentionally alter their appearance. Factors such as the growth of facial hair and the aging process can significantly change an individual's facial features, making it difficult to match them with existing records or identify them from surveillance footage. These challenges can lead to delays in investigations, false identifications, and missed opportunities for apprehension. 
The proposed solution involves the development and implementation of a sophisticated facial recognition system that integrates cutting-edge deep learning techniques, specifically utilizing StyleGAN for facial attribute transformation. By using a StyleGAN model on a criminal faces, the system  applies the learned transformations to simulate the effects of aging and beard growth on the suspect's facial appearance. This process generates synthetic images that represent the suspect's potential altered appearance, aiding investigators in visualizing potential changes and facilitating more accurate identification.
The system's ability to simulate aging and beard growth enhances its effectiveness in tracking suspects over time, even as they attempt to change their appearance.
This project aims to empower law enforcement agencies with a powerful tool for more accurate and efficient criminal identification, ultimately contributing to enhanced public safety and security.
